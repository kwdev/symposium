# About Symposium

Symposium is a set of components that make AI agents work better. These components are compatible with any ACP-based editing system, including Zed, VSCode (with our plugin), and IntelliJ and NeoVim (coming soon).

We focus on three areas:

<div class="tenets-grid">

<div class="tenet-section">
  <h2>Rust Expertise</h2>
  <p>Built-in capabilities for understanding Rust language, errors, and idioms.</p>
  <ul class="tenet-examples">
    <li class="works"><a href="./rust-expertise.md">rust-crate-sources tool</a></li>
    <li class="coming-soon">IDE operations</li>
    <li class="coming-soon">Error explanations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="tenet-section">
  <h2>Ecosystem-Powered Knowledge</h2>
  <p>Crate authors provide specialized AI tooling through Cargo.toml metadata, bringing domain knowledge directly to the agent.</p>
  <ul class="tenet-examples">
    <li class="coming-soon">Crate-provided skills, context, and capabilities</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="tenet-section">
  <h2>Rich Collaboration</h2>
  <p>Interactive patterns for human-AI partnership beyond simple text exchanges.</p>
  <ul class="tenet-examples">
    <li class="coming-soon"><a href="./rich-collaboration.md">Sparkle collaborative patterns</a></li>
    <li class="coming-soon">Walkthroughs</li>
    <li class="coming-soon">Taskspaces</li>
  </ul>
</div>

</div>

## Open Source Community

Symposium is an open-source project and we are actively soliciting [contributors](./contribute.md). We welcome users as well, but given the exploratory nature of Symposium, expect frequent changes. Currently, the only way to install Symposium is from source.

We maintain a [code of conduct](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and operate as an independent community focused on exploring what AI has to offer for software development.

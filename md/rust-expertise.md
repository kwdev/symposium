# Rust Crate Sources Tool

The `rust-crate-sources` MCP tool allows AI agents to access the source code of published Rust crates from crates.io.

Just like humans, AI agents work best when they have a few examples of what to do rather than having to sort through reams of documentation. Often the best way to provide this is to expose them to the crate's source code, since well-maintained crates come equipped with examples and usage patterns.

When an agent needs to understand how a particular crate works, it can fetch and examine the actual implementation, including any examples or tests the crate provides.
